// Adding an image carousel in the gallery on the Beachstays home page

// Add navigation arrows
    // perhaps with ::before and ::after pseudo elements
// grab other assets from the page assets to expand the number of photos in the carousel
// Since the shown images will have to change perhaps add the urls to an array in JS
    // Or would it be easier to load them all at once and just display them off screen for load times?
// Add an event listener to the navigation arrows to allow for the updating of the shown images
